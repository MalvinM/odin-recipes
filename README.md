Hello and welcome to my HTML website project! In this project, I will be learning the basics of HTML, the language used to create websites. HTML is the foundation of every website and is essential for anyone looking to become a web developer or designer.

Throughout this project, I will learn how to structure content on a web page using HTML tags such as headers, paragraphs, and lists. I will also learn how to add links, images, and videos to my pages, as well as how to use CSS to style my content.

By the end of this project, I will have gained a solid understanding of HTML and be able to create my own basic websites from scratch. This project is perfect for me as a beginner who is looking to get started in web development or for anyone who wants to improve their knowledge of HTML.

Skills I will learn during this project:

Basic HTML syntax and tags
Creating headers, paragraphs, and lists
Adding links, images, and videos
Styling content with CSS
Creating a basic web page from scratch
I'm excited to get started and can't wait to see what I can create with my new HTML skills!
